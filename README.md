# `TeXURL` - LaTeX Parser for Content Containing URLs

Download content from links inside your TeX files locally and link it.  
No, this is not present in any of the LaTeX compilers (Yes, even i'm surprised!)  
Inspired by [this](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/89521) StackExchange answer.  

## Script

```bash
python ".\src\test.py" ".\test\test_1.tex"
```

## Changes

- Add verbose option to display or not the content.
- Create log file to store errors.
